The year is 2040 and aliens have landed in York.
They have taken over several buildings in York town but it's not over yet! The aliens have one key weakness: water. The York Fire department has offered their fire engines however all the firemen are currently busy rescuing a goose from a tree.
It's up to you to save York.
